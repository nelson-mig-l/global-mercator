#TMS Global Mercator Profile

Functions necessary for generation of tiles in Spherical Mercator projection,
EPSG:900913 (EPSG:gOOglE, Google Maps Global Mercator), EPSG:3785, OSGEO:41001.
Such tiles are compatible with Google Maps, Microsoft Virtual Earth, Yahoo Maps,
UK Ordnance Survey OpenSpace API, ...
and you can overlay them on top of base maps of those web mapping applications.
	
	Pixel and tile coordinates are in TMS notation (origin [0,0] in bottom-left).

###What is the coordinate extent of Earth in EPSG:900913?
[-20037508.342789244, -20037508.342789244, 20037508.342789244, 20037508.342789244]
Constant 20037508.342789244 comes from the circumference of the Earth in meters,
which is 40 thousand kilometers, the coordinate origin is in the middle of extent.
In fact you can calculate the constant as: `2 * math.pi * 6378137 / 2.0`.
Polar areas with abs(latitude) bigger then 85.05112878 are clipped off.
###What are zoom level constants (pixels/meter) for pyramid with EPSG:900913?
Whole region is on top of pyramid (zoom=0) covered by 256x256 pixels tile,
every lower zoom level resolution is always divided by two.
`initialResolution = 20037508.342789244 * 2 / 256 = 156543.03392804062`
###What is the difference between TMS and Google Maps/QuadTree tile name convention?
The tile raster itself is the same (equal extent, projection, pixel size),
there is just different identification of the same raster tile.
Tiles in TMS are counted from [0,0] in the bottom-left corner, id is XYZ.
Google placed the origin [0,0] to the top-left corner, reference is XYZ.
Microsoft is referencing tiles by a QuadTree name, defined on the website:
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx
###The lat/lon coordinates are using WGS84 datum, yeh?
Yes, all lat/lon we are mentioning should use WGS84 Geodetic Datum.
Well, the web clients like Google Maps are projecting those coordinates by
Spherical Mercator, so in fact lat/lon coordinates on sphere are treated as if
the were on the WGS84 ellipsoid.

From MSDN documentation:
>To simplify the calculations, we use the spherical form of projection, not
the ellipsoidal form. Since the projection is used only for map display,
and not for displaying numeric coordinates, we don't need the extra precision
of an ellipsoidal projection. The spherical projection causes approximately
0.33 percent scale distortion in the Y direction, which is not visually noticable.
###How do I create a raster in EPSG:900913 and convert coordinates with PROJ.4?
You can use standard GIS tools like gdalwarp, cs2cs or gdaltransform.
All of the tools supports -t_srs 'epsg:900913'.
For other GIS programs check the exact definition of the projection:
More info at http://spatialreference.org/ref/user/google-projection/
The same projection is degined as EPSG:3785. WKT definition is in the official
EPSG database.
